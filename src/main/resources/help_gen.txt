    gen <name> with <program>
    [ obtain <fact> ]
    [ as <name> ]

This command can be used to apply the dynamic logic generalisation
rule. The conclusion of the selected fact is prefixed with a box
operator containing the given program.

The obtained formula may be reported after the obtain keyword. This is
optional but helpful for better traceability.

If no name is set (after "as"), a fresh number is chosen and used as
name.

Example:

  Fact F:
    X |- p->q

> gen F with a+b;c* as R .

  Fact R:
    X |- [a + (b ; c)*](p -> q)
