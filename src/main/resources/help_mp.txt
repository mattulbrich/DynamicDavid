    mp [ inst ] <name> with <name>
    [ obtain <fact> ]
    [ as <name> ]

This command can be used to apply modus ponens rule
on two facts.

The two conclusions of the two facts must match the requirements of
modus ponens: one must be an implication (A->B) in which the second
must the premiss (A). The resulting fact is (B) with the assumptions
of both input facts.

The obtained formula may be reported after the obtain keyword. This is
optional but helpful for better traceability.

If no name is set (after "as"), a fresh number is chosen and used as
name.

Example:

  Fact Fact1:
    X, Y |- A -> B -> A
  Fact Fact2:
    X, Z |- A
  Fact Fact3:
         |- p -> q

> mp Fact1 with Fact2 as Result .

  Fact Result:
    X, Y, Z |- B -> A

> mp inst Fact1 with Fact3 as MatchedResult .

  Fact MatchedResult:
    X. Y |- B -> p -> q
