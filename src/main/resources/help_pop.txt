    pop from <name>
    [ obtain <fact> ]
    [ as <name> ]

This command can be used to apply the deduction theorem.  The
conclusion of the selected fact must be an implication. The
left-hand-side of the implication is moved to the premisses in the
resulting fact.

The obtained formula may be reported after the obtain keyword. This is
optional but helpful for better traceability.

If no name is set (after "as"), a fresh number is chosen and used as
name.

Example:

Fact F:
  |- p -> q

> pop from F as R .

Fact R:
  p |- q
