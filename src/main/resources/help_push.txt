    push <formula> from <name>
    [ obtain <fact> ]
    [ as <name> ]

This command can be used to apply the deduction theorem.  The
mentioned formula must be amongst the premisses of the selected
fact. The formula is added as left-hand-side of an implication.

The obtained formula may be reported after the obtain keyword. This is
optional but helpful for better traceability.

If no name is set (after "as"), a fresh number is chosen and used as
name.

Example:

Fact F:
  X, Y, Z |- A

> push Y from F as R .

Fact R:
  X, Z |- Y -> A
