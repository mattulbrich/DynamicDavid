Dynamic David is a command line tool. You conduct proofs by issuing proof commands.
If you do it interactively, you must terminate your input with "." to tell the
interpreter that you want it to work on your input.

You can also provide a text file as argument to the program, its content is
then interpreted.

The state of the proof interpreter is a map from identifiers to known "facts".
A fact is a statement of the form M |- phi for a (finite) set of formulas
