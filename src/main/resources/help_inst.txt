    inst <name>
    with <var>=<formula>, <var>=<formula>, ...
         program <var>=<program>, <var>=<program>, ... 
    [ obtain <fact> ]
    [ as <name> ]

This command can be used to instantiate the propositional variables
and atomic programs of a known fact by formulas and programs.

The instantiated variables must be listed after the keyword
"with". Atomic programs must be prefixed with the keyword "program".

The obtained formula may be reported after the obtain keyword. This is
optional but helpful for better traceability.

If no name is set (after "as"), a fresh number is chosen and used as
name.

Example:

>    assume [a*]p -> p as Zero .

Fact Zero:
 |- [a*]p -> p

>    inst Zero with p=[C]x->y, program a=D
>     obtain |- [D*]([C]x->y) -> [C]x->y
>     as Result .

Fact Result:
 |- [D*]([C]x -> y) -> [C]x -> y
