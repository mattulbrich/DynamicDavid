This commandline tool allows you to conduct formal proofs in a Hilbert
calculus for propositional dynamic logic (PDL). The calculus is
introduced, e.g.,
https://github.com/mattulbrich/DynamicDavid/calculus.md

This is (mainly) for teaching purposes as the calculus is provably
effective, by quite inefficient. It's called "Dynamic David" since
Hilbert's first name is David.
