You can obtain help for the available commands by calling "help <commandName>."
(Not all commands have a help page.)

Control:
   help <subtopic>     -- These help pages
   quit                -- quit Dynamic David
   clear all           -- forget all known facts
   clear               -- forget all temporary facts (#1, #2, ...)
   clear <name>        -- forget a fact by name
   load "<filename>"   -- read the file and interpret it
   facts               -- show all known facts
   fact <name>         -- show a particular fact
   set <prop>="<val>"  -- set a prover system property

Proof Control:

   assume <formula> [ as <name> ]
      -- axiomatically introduce a new formula to the set of known facts.

   inst <id> with <var>=<formula> [ , <var>=<formula> , ... ] [ as <name> ]
      -- instantiate a known formula by substituting prop. variables

   mp <id> with <id> [ as <name> ]
      -- do modus ponens with two facts

   gen <id> [ as <name> ]
      -- generalise a fact

   pop from <id> [ as <name> ]
      -- apply the Deduction Theorem on a fact

   push <formula> from <id> [ as <name> ]
      -- apply the Deduction Theorem in reverse direction on a fact

   thm <formula> as <name>
   proof <commands> end
      -- conduct a proof for a formula in a localised namespace
