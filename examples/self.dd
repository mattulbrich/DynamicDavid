thm a |- a as self
proof
  load "axioms.dd" unless Ax1

  inst Ax2 with b=b -> a, c=a
    obtain  |- (a -> (b -> a) -> a) -> (a -> b -> a) -> a -> a as E1
  
  inst Ax1 with b=b -> a
    obtain  |- a -> (b -> a) -> a as E2
  
  mp E1 with E2
    obtain  |- (a -> b -> a) -> a -> a as E3
  
  mp E3 with Ax1
    obtain  |- a -> a as E4
  
  pop from E4 as goal
